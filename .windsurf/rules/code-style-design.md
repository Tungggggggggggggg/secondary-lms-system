Priorities (in order):
- Clarity

- Cleanliness
- Familiarity
- Emotional experience
- Consistency
- Scalability

# 2. Core UX Principles (Must-Know for Every Screen)

| Principle              | Rule for Coders                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Gestalt**            | Group related items → proximity, same style, shared container, clear fg/bg      |
| **Fitts’s Law**        | Touch/action targets ≥ 40–48px · Put primary actions where thumb/cursor lands |
| **Hick’s Law**         | Fewer choices = faster decisions → group, prioritize, hide secondary options   |
| **Miller’s Law**       | Chunk content into 5–9 items max → cards, sections, accordions                  |
| **Jakob’s Law**        | Use familiar patterns (nav, forms, lists) → don’t reinvent the wheel           |
| **Doherty Threshold**  | System response ≤ 400ms → always show skeleton/spinner/shimmer                  |
| **Accessibility**      | WCAG contrast, ≥14–16px text, ARIA labels, full keyboard support, icons with alt/context |
| **Visual Hierarchy**   | Size + weight + color + spacing = obvious importance order                      |
| **Consistency**        | Same design tokens, components, motion across the entire product                |
| **Simplicity**         | Ruthlessly remove anything that doesn’t help the user complete the task      |

# 3. Advanced UX Rules (Apply Whenever Possible)

| Rule                        | Implementation Guideline                                                      |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| UX Writing                  | Clear, concise, action-first · No jargon · Context-appropriate tone           |
| Progressive Disclosure      | Show only what’s needed now · Expand on demand                               |
| Mental Model                | Design how users think, not how engineers think                                |
| Natural Mapping             | Control position matches real-world expectation (no upside-down sliders)     |
| Error Prevention            | Real-time validation > error messages                                         |
| Affordance                  | Buttons must look clickable, inputs must look fillable                        |
| Information Architecture    | Menu by user goals, never by internal org structure                           |
| Task Flow Optimization      | Minimize clicks, steps, cognitive switches                                    |
| Micro-interactions          | Hover states, ripples, shake on error, check on success, smooth transitions |
| Visual Balance & Rhythm     | 8pt spacing system, consistent whitespace rhythm                              |
| Layout Grid                 | 12-column grid, strict alignment                                              |
| Responsiveness              | Mobile-first or adaptive · ≥44–48px touch targets                             |
| Loading Strategy            | Skeleton screens, prefetch, lazy-load, optimistic UI when safe                |
| System Feedback             | Every user action → instant visual/audio feedback                              |
| Emotional Design            | Success = delight · Error = serious but helpful · Empty = encouraging + actionable |
| Design Tokens               | Centralized colors, radii, typography, spacing, shadows, motion, states      |
| Scalability                 | UI must not break when data grows (virtualized lists, pagination, etc.)      |
| Safe Action Priority        | Dan
